v0.0.3

Log:
    - Moved FirebaseIO.mjs, PageManager.mjs & ReferenceStorage.mjs into 'core' folder.
    - Moved Page.mjs into 'pages' folder.
    - Created LoginPage.mjs, and made it display when first opening the site.
    - Made 'getHTML()' and 'getId()' in 'Page.mjs' public, as private versions caused errors.
